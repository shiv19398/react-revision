Not a framework which means it focues only on one thing and that is UI which it does really well.

The technical features that makes React a good choice are :

1. Component Based Architecture:- A traditional website can be broken down into a)Header b)SideNav c)Main content d)Footer. Each sections makes up a component which when composed in a right way build up the entire website.

2. Reusable Code:- Components make it possible to reuse code in React. For example:- You created a article component in React , this same component can be used in Angular and Vue by passing right amount of data.

3. React is declarative:-
   a) Tell React what you want and React will build the actual UI.
   b) React will handle efficiently updating and rendering of the components.
