There is second way to influence what is rendered on the screen

we should not change the state directly.
Always use setState method in case of class Component
If you modify the state directly, the react will not re-render the Component
Calls to setState are asynchronous
the setState method has two parameters :-
1. state object
2. callback function:- Code has to be executed after the state has been updated? Place that code in the call back function which is the second argument to the setState method.

React may group multiple setState calls into one setState calls to optimize the performance

When you have to update the state based on the previous state value, pass in a function as an argument instead of the regular object.
