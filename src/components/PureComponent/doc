We can create a component by extending the PureComponent Class.

A PureComponent implements the shouldComponentUpdate lifecycle method by performing a shallow comparison on the props and state of the component.

If there is no difference, the component is not re-rendered - performance boost

It is a good idea to ensure that all the children components are also pure to avoid unexpected behaviour.

Never mutate the state. Always return a new object that reflects the new state.
